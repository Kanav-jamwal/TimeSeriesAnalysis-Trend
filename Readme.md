## Time Series Analysis using Auto Regressor and logistic , Box Cox Transformation.

Food Retail data of Australia Capital Territory has been analysed:

1. **Sub series plot to check the variation in each month over a particular year.**

2. **The different type of transformation has been applied to the data to make it stationary :**

 * Log Transformation
 * Power Transformation with different lambda
 * BoxCox transformation with automatic selection
